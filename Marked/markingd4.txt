CSCC01 Deliverable 4 Marking Guide
-----------------------------------

Project Management:   (18/20%)

	[see deliverable 3 comments]
  Release plan: 3/3
    - each release corresponds to end of Sprint
    - project fully laid out:
      for each release date, list of user stories to implement
    - project velocity specified and used
    - highest priority user stories first modulo dependencies
    - reasonable goals for each release
  
  Product Backlog: 3/3
    - user stories follow the correct format.
    - user stories, together, reflect all the user requirements (from
      all personas).
    - user stories correspond to actual requirements (no "invented"
      features).
    - user stories contain enough information for devs to estimate how
      long it would take to implement it.
    - each user story addresses one specific requirement (no "world
      peace" stories).

  Sprint Backlog(s): 2/2
     - user stories taken from the Product Backlog
     - estimated costs
     - estimated values

  Sprint Plan(s): 3/3
    - user stories divided into tasks when appropriate.
    - each Sprint Plan contains all the necessary information:
        who is working on which task on which day 
    - sum of costs of user stories in the sprint = project velocity
    - good planning decisions

  Use of Task Board: 2/2
    - correct format of task boards
    - snapshots in the begginning and end of each Sprint are provided
    
  Use of Burndown Charts: 2/3
  *-1 no snapshots of beginning of burndown chart
    - snapshots in the begginning and end of each Sprint are provided
    - correctness of burndown charts

  Use of Repo: 2/2
      (including good use of branching from now on!)

  Use of communication tools: 2/2
     - evidence of using communication tools of their choice effectively


Design and Implementation:   (4/30%)

   System Design: (2/5)
   *-3 system design not detailed enough
      - good modular design
      - general and easy to extend
      - it is clear how the current implementation is going to be
        extended into an application that satisfies the client's needs

   Implementation:
   (0/10)
   -10 crashed no module named requests
     - 0 marks if it doesn't run
     - most of the features are either fully implemented of nearly implemented
     - quality and maturity of code


Verification and Validation:   (18/25%)

     - quality of unit tests: (4/10)
     *-6 missing unit tests for many classes
         - good coverage
	 - no redundancy
     - code review activities and outcomes: (10/10)
         - each review follows a checklist (not necessarily the example one, but the same checklist for all)
	 - each review is thorough
	 - evidence of addressing the outcomes of the review
	 - the video demonstrates an effective process used for the review/collection meeting
     - validation activities and outcomes: (5/5)
          - evidence of feedback from the user
	  - evidence of addressing feedback from the user


Report:  (12/15%)

  - well-presented, is easy to read and to navigate
  - spelling and grammar
  - looks professional
  - quality of the README file
  *-3 README doesn't say which code to run


Interview:  (7/10%)
*-3 program was crashing because of unimplemented feature
