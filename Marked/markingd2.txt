Personas:  17 / 20

  -1 most family/personal information is not relevant
  Format: 3 / 4

      must contain: gender, age, personality, skills, environment,
      attitude towards technology in general, attitude towards
      computer software  
      Too many irrelevant details are not useful!

  -2 for not mentioning proficiency with version control
  Information content:  6 / 8
   
      The purpose of each persona is clear. Personas suggest different
      system requirements.
        
      Goals when using the system


  Coverage: 8 / 8

      personas must include at least two of the following type of users:

      -- "Hanno type"

      -- Hanno's grad student: can approve modifications to the data,
           but cannot add other such users (only Hanno can)

      -- A less tech-savvy astronomer: Sure, Hanno is the client who
           makes the order, but the software will be released as
           open-source, so other types of users are 100% realistic.


Product Backlog:  36 / 50

    10 / 10 : User stories follow the format
                "As __name__ (__role__), I want __something__."
		("so that __benefit__" is optional)
	       AND each __name__ corresponds to one of the personas.
    
    User stories don't specify how Alice will use the application
    -5
    5 / 10 : User stories, together, reflect all the user
    	        requirements (from all prospective users).

    10 / 10 : User stories correspond to actual requirements (no
    	        "invented" features).


    almost all user stories are vague and its difficult to estimate time -5
    5 / 10 : User stories contain enough information for devs to
                estimate how long it would take to implement it.
    
    User story one is encompasses too much for each persona.
    Many user stories need to be more specific.  See feeback.
    6 / 10 : Each user story addresses one specific requirement (no
                "world peace" stories).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marking format:

Please, produce a text or pdf file for each team. This file should
contain the above rubric. 

Please, provide comments to the teams. I require a comment for each
rubric where you are deducting any marks. But perhaps more
importantly, I would like you to provide enough help to make sure
every team can make good progress on the next stage of the project.

How you should provide comments? I will leave the format to you, since
I know how personal the choice of editor, etc., can be, and I don't
want to slow you down.

Some options in case you are not sure what to choose:
 -- annotate a pdf submission with your comments
 -- add the comments to the file with the rubric
 -- create a separate file for the comments
 -- ... 

I ask that you are consistent: use the same format for each team.

As always, please let me know if you have any questions, concerns,
suggestions, etc.!


Cheers,
A.
