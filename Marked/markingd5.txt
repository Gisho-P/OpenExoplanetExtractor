CSCC01 Deliverable 5 Marking Guide
-----------------------------------

Project Management:   (16/20%)

  Release plan: 2/3
  *-1 no mention of sprint velocity
    - each release corresponds to end of Sprint
    - project fully laid out:
      for each release date, list of user stories to implement
    - project velocity specified and used
    - highest priority user stories first modulo dependencies
    - reasonable goals for each release
  
  Product Backlog: 3/3
    - user stories follow the correct format.
    - user stories, together, reflect all the user requirements (from
      all personas).
    - user stories correspond to actual requirements (no "invented"
      features).
    - user stories contain enough information for devs to estimate how
      long it would take to implement it.
    - each user story addresses one specific requirement (no "world
      peace" stories).

  Sprint Backlog(s): 2/2
     - user stories taken from the Product Backlog
     - estimated costs
     - estimated values

  Sprint Plan(s): 1/3
  *-1 no mention of who is doing what
  *-1 decsription of tasks isn't present
    - user stories divided into tasks when appropriate.
    - each Sprint Plan contains all the necessary information:
        who is working on which task on which day 
    - sum of costs of user stories in the sprint = project velocity
    - good planning decisions

  Use of Task Board: 2/2
    - correct format of task boards
    - snapshots in the begginning and end of each Sprint are provided
    
  Use of Burndown Charts: 2/2
    - snapshots in the begginning and end of each Sprint are provided
    - correctness of burndown charts

  Use of Repo: 1/2
  *-1 creation of branches seems arbitrary
      (including good use of branching from now on!)

  Use of communication tools: 2/2
     - evidence of using communication tools of their choice effectively

	 - evidence of addressing the outcomes of the review
	 - the video demonstrates an effective process used for the review/collection meeting
     - validation activities and outcomes: (1/4)
